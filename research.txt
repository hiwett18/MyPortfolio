Bootstrap:
    Bootstrap uses media queries to modify sites depending on devices type.
    Since Bootstrap is designed with mobile devices in mind, it employs number of media queries to provide 
    logical breakpoints for our layouts and user interfaces.
    1. Copy-paste the stylesheet <link> into your <head> before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.0.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm" crossorigin="anonymous">
    2. Breakpoints allow us to scale up items when the viewport changes and are often based on minimum viewport widths as shown below:
                // Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
                // No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap

                // Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
                @media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

                // Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
                @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

                // Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
                @media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

                // Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
                @media (min-width: 1200px) { ... } 



Material UI:

    It allows you to easily build highly appealing websites.
